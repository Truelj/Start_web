Continuously learning about how to write the standard class methods, such as toString, valueOf, toJSON, equal() and compareTo(), which are adopted as Java conventions.

Serialization:
    Is a process of converting an bject's state to a string form from which it can later be restored.
    
Type supported by JSON
    Finate numbers, true, false, string, object, null
    
    not supported by JSON
    Function, undefined...
    
Two methods related to serialization
    JSON.stringif()
    object's toJSON()//called by JSON.stringif()
    

Standard conversion methods
    equal()
        To enable instances of your class to be tested for equalty by calling equals() method, rather than comparing them by using equality operators.
        In the body of equal(), one should test whether 2 objects are instances of the same type.
        
    compareTo()
        To enable instances of your class to be compared by calling compareTo() method, rather than comparing them by using comparision operators.
        In the body of equal(), one should test whether 2 objects are instances of the same type.
