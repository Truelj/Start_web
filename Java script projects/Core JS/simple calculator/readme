Build a simple calculator by using JavaScript. This simple application is to make use of
what I learned about the core JS, which includes the language syntax and the core API that
should be built in most JS interpreters.

In this application, I implement the idea of stack and make use of the object-oriented methodology.
More than that, I also the stack and algorithm to process the arithmetic equation, which is actually
treated as a string in my application.

To run the application, open calculation.htm in the browser

Here are the logs of my progress:
Jan 7:
  Create the stack.
Jan 8:
  Read the equation as a sequence of digit characters, binary arithmetic operators,
  the opening brace character and the closing brace character. No space is allowed in a number expression, e.g "1 23".
  Actually there's no place to input the equation, so I just treat the
  equation as a string, and assign it to a variable.

  The algorithm that I used to evaluate the equation is divided into two steps:
    1. Convert the equation to a postfix expression by using 2 stacks.
    2. Evaluate the postfix expression to get the result.
Jan 9:
  Just realized that I don't have to create a stack. I can simply use array functions, such as
  push(), pop(), unshift(), and shift().

  Instead of using conditional statement to decide whether an input token is an operator, I use
  the "in" operator to test if Operator, which is actually an enumerated type, has a property named by
  that operator. In order to do that, I need to:
    1. create a factory function named "enumeration".
    2. use that "enumeration" function to create a new enumerated type.
